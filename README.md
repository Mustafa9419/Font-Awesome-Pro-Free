## Author's Note

This small automated project was created for educational purposes only. This was created to practice and play with GitHub Actions. This repository was publicized as a demonstration and example of GitHub Actions's automation for you to peek at the code.

The way FontAwesome's monetization works is by buying the *license* to use the icons. As such, you are only allowed to use this for personal testing or previewing (free trial) before paying the premium. Do support Font Awesome and pay for the premium if you can afford it!
